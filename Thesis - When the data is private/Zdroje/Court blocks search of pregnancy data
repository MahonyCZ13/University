Abstract: [Phil Havens] contends the names of women who took pregnancy tests are not protected by doctor-patient privilege because the Planned Parenthood staff members who administer pregnancy tests aren't required to be doctors or nurses.

Full text: A shredding machine had just completed its work on a load of trash when an employee at the county recycling center spotted the remains of a dark-haired baby boy born less than two days earlier.
Police questioned garbage collectors and asked doctors from area hospitals about women who had given birth recently. Nothing, including extensive forensic tests, pointed toward who placed the child in the garbage or why.
Facing a dead end, Buena Vista County investigators asked area hospitals and clinics for the names of women with positive pregnancy tests between last August and May, roughly the period of the mother's pregnancy.
That request triggered a legal battle over medical privacy that has landed in the Iowa Supreme Court. The battle has thrust this northwest Iowa town into a national debate about how to balance privacy and justice.
The names of an unknown number of once-expectant mothers were given to the sheriff's department, but Storm Lake's Planned Parenthood clinic refused to share the information, citing doctor- patient confidentiality.
Prosecutors then obtained a court order requiring the clinic to provide by Aug. 17 the names and addresses of all women who tested positive for pregnancy between Aug. 15, 2001, and May 30, the date the child was found.
On Tuesday, the Iowa Supreme Court granted a stay of the lower court's order while it decides whether it will hear Planned Parenthood's appeal. The news came the day before the Buena Vista County sheriff's office was to hold a burial service for the child.
"We would like to help them, but the help that they are asking for we think is both illegal and unethical, so we can't comply," said Jill June, director of Planned Parenthood of Greater Iowa.
Clinic handled 1,000 cases
June said more than 1,000 women received treatment inside the small brick clinic in the city's downtown during the last year. She said she doesn't know how many of those women had positive pregnancy tests.
It is not unusual for Planned Parenthood to receive a subpoena seeking information about a client suspected of a crime, but June and others say the net cast this time is far too wide.
"It's unprecedented in the scope of the subpoena and the information being requested," said Randall Wilson, legal director for the Iowa Civil Liberties Union in Des Moines.
Wilson said the release of information such as pregnancy results could discourage women from seeking prenatal care.
"If we can't even protect these records, then other records of health services to patients are also completely in jeopardy," Wilson said. "This issue doesn't just affect a few pregnant women in a small town."
Buena Vista County Atty. Phil Havens said he has few other options than to use pregnancy test results in his search for the person responsible for a crime that could range from illegal disposal of a body to murder.
"We have to find the mother because she is the only person who can tell us what happened to this baby," he said.
Investigators acknowledge chances are slim that the mother in question ever took a pregnancy test at the Storm Lake clinic, but they say their job is to check out even the slimmest of possibilities.
Havens contends the names of women who took pregnancy tests are not protected by doctor-patient privilege because the Planned Parenthood staff members who administer pregnancy tests aren't required to be doctors or nurses.
Still, June said women are told their visit to the clinic is confidential. She said the tests are performed under the standing protocols of a nurse and doctor.
Doubts about residency
Storm Lake has a transient population, and that has made some residents doubt the likelihood that the mother even lived in the area at the time she might have sought a pregnancy test.
The town's two meatpacking plants have brought a mix of residents to this corner of Iowa. There are workers from Mexico, Peru and Guatemala as well as Southeast Asia.
The case has also left some wondering why the mother didn't drop the child off at a hospital. Like Illinois, Iowa has a law that allows mothers or fathers to legally drop off unwanted and unharmed infants at a safe place.
The American Civil Liberties Union, Planned Parenthood of America and the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League are closely monitoring the case, as are medical providers.
Residents in Storm Lake say they are having a hard time deciding who is right in the dispute.
"It's about as mixed an opinion as you could ever find," said Mary Lou Freeman, a state senator who represents the area. "Most people would like to see a resolution and someone made to pay for the destruction of a life, but on the other hand I hear a lot about the privacy."
That some medical providers turned over information about pregnant women has outraged some in this community of about 10,000 people, a college town that's home to one of Iowa's few sizable lakes.
Woman mulls lawsuit
One woman is considering legal action against her medical clinic after it turned over her test information without her permission.
"I feel for this baby that we all grieve for, but that does not obliterate the need for privacy," said the woman, who had taken a pregnancy test.
Other medical providers are closely watching the case.
"If these type of medical records are allowed to be released, then what does that say about all medical records held by all medical providers?" said Jeanine Freeman of the Iowa Medical Society.
The legal battle has already been felt at Storm Lake's Buena Vista University, which provides a significant portion of the clinic's clientele.
"If they do get this, I think a lot of people will think twice about going there," said Megan Dudley, 18, a student who has visited the clinic. "It's supposed to be a place that you can go to and feel safe."
