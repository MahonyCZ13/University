Abstract: A Tarrant County woman is suing Internet search portal Yahoo, alleging that the company is violating state's anti-stalking law by placing "cookies" on her computer and observing where she surfs the Web. "It's a stretch to say Yahoo is stalking someone by virtue of having placed a relatively benign cookie on their hard drive," says Marcelo Halpern, a partner at Chicago law firm Gordon and Glickson. Mr. [Lawrence Friedman] is also suing Yahoo in a separate case that alleges a breach of contract between Yahoo and Chalkboard.com.

Sort of.
A Tarrant County woman is suing Internet search portal Yahoo, alleging that the company is violating state's anti-stalking law by placing "cookies" on her computer and observing where she surfs the Web.
The suit, filed Feb. 12 in Dallas County District Court by Karen Stewart and her lawyer, says the company and its subsidiary, Broadcast.com, has also trespassed on personal property and committed civil theft.
Lawrence Friedman, who is representing the case, says he is asking the court to grant the case class-action status, which would allow Yahoo's more than 50 million users to participate in it.
"All of the people who use Yahoo have unwittingly had surveillance cookies placed on their hard drives in their houses and offices," Mr. Friedman says.
The suit points out that Yahoo acknowledges in its privacy policy that it uses cookies to research its users' demographics, interests and behaviours on its site.
"Such uses allow the defendants to watch, to spy, to conduct surveillance, to analyse the habits, inclinations, preferences, and tastes and otherwise to follow and stalk those who visit the defendants' sites," the suit says.
There are apparently no legal precedents in using the Texas anti- stalking law in a civil case showing that a person's privacy rights have been violated.
"The case presents a very creative legal theory but is completely off base and, in some ways, flat-out wrong," says Jon Sobel, associate general counsel for Yahoo.
"There's no question that privacy is an important issue, but the case is unfortunate because, in our view, it needlessly scares people."
Mr. Sobel says Yahoo does not follow its users around the Web and that it uses cookies only to anonymously aggregate user behaviour.
Legal experts say the case brings Internet privacy issues to the forefront but that it is unlikely to be successful.
"It's a stretch to say Yahoo is stalking someone by virtue of having placed a relatively benign cookie on their hard drive," says Marcelo Halpern, a partner at Chicago law firm Gordon and Glickson.
Mr. Friedman is also suing Yahoo in a separate case that alleges a breach of contract between Yahoo and Chalkboard.com.
