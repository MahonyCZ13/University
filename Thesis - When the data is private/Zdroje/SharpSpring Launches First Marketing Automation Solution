Full text: SharpSpring Launches First Marketing Automation Solution to Feature Fully Integrated Call Tracking, Web Tracking and CRM
Now with Call Tracking, SharpSpring Provides Real-time, Actionable Data and a Unified View of the Customer
GAINESVILLE, Fla. & CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--September 15, 2014--
SharpSpring, an SMTP company (NASDAQ:SMTP) and an innovation leader in marketing automation, today launched integrated call tracking as the newest feature of its marketing automation solution, providing a unified view of the customer, including both web and phone touch points that arm the sales force with real-time, actionable data.
SharpSpring's expanded platform combines the power of call tracking and web tracking in a seamlessly integrated CRM and marketing automation platform. It is the first major product enhancement to be released following SharpSpring's acquisition by SMTP in August.
"With integrated call tracking, SharpSpring pulls together all relevant customer touch points in a single, powerful platform for the first time, " said Rick Carlson, president of SharpSpring. "Outbound email marketing, web tracking, one-off emails, inbound phone calls and notes from phone calls are all presented in real-time in a single, unified view, providing actionable sales intelligence and automated marketing communications."

The phone is arguably the most valuable sales enablement channel for many businesses today, and the addition of call tracking to the SharpSpring platform leverages the exponential growth of inbound mobile calls as an important sales catalyst.
Mobile devices are driving phone sales leads to their highest point in history. By 2018, BIA/Kelsey estimates that mobile search will generate 73 billion calls to businesses, up from 30 billion in 2013. Google reports that 70 percent of mobile shoppers have used the click-to-call button to connect with a business directly from mobile search results.
"StringCan has been waiting for an integrated solution like SharpSpring's enhanced marketing automation platform," said Jay Feitlinger, founder and CEO, StringCan Interactive. "Call tracking is vital to StringCan's digital marketing strategy, since many of our client's leads come through the phone, and all other marketing automation solutions fail to address this critical channel integrated with a robust CRM and lead insights. Now, when a call comes in to our client's sales team, we can see the history, including recordings of the calls, of that customer in real-time, what drove them to the website, where they've been on their website, what they've purchased recently and what they're looking to buy. It's like being nearsighted and suddenly putting on glasses."
Unlike many competitors, SharpSpring is vendor agnostic, seamlessly integrating with any CRM solution and working across all website platforms and content management systems. It can also function as a powerful, complete, end-to-end solution featuring SharpSpring's CRM platform, depending on user needs.
"SharpSpring leapfrogs existing players because we provide a clearer, more complete picture of the customer than anyone else on the market today," said Jon Strimling, CEO of SMTP. "This fits perfectly with our vision of helping businesses and organizations reach and connect with their customers like never before. Given the importance of inbound calls in the mobile world, this is an exciting addition to our suite of marketing technology solutions and also fits well with our strategy of providing cost-effective solutions. SharpSpring provides an integrated marketing automation, CRM and call tracking package for less than our competitors offer just one of these solutions."
